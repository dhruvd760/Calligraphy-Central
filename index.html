        <h1>What is Calligraphy?</h1>
        <p>Calligraphy is the art of beautifully crafted lettering, where handwriting 
            transforms into an expressive and elegant form of visual design. More than

           letters in a way that enhances their aesthetic appeal. Artists often use different techniques to create patterns, flourishes
          and unique designs. The beauty of calligraphy lies in the balance between form and style
         where every stroke and curve contribute to overall visual appeal.In earlier times it was 
        used to create manuscripts, religious texts, and official documents. Whether used for 
        artistic expression, historical manuscripts, or modern design, calligraphy is
        a unique blend of tradition and innovation that continues to captivate people
        across cultures.Even today, calligraphy is popular choice to design wedding invitations, greeting cards, logos, and certificates.

         thousands of years. It originated in ancient civilizations, with early 
         examples found in Mesopotamia around 3500 BC, where people used cuneiform
          script on clay tablets. The Greeks and Romans later refined writing
           techniques, leading to the development of elegant scripts. </p>
